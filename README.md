ONLINE AUTOMATED SHOP MANAGEMENT
Suppose you want to start a retail business but you don’t have the capital to start a physical store. What can you do? With our program, you can do it online without the need of any physical front. You can store your products at home and upload a list online and the rest of the process the programm will do for you. It will guide your customers to buy their desired products online. And since it's automated, you don’t have to stay online all the time either. The program will sell your products, set them on deliveries, and deal with the payment system. All you have to do is maintain a supply chain and deliver the products once n order arrives.
